<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Ian. I am currently a sophomore and my major is currently undecided, but<br>
I am interested in computer and data sciences. My family consists of me,<br>
my mom, my dad and my brother and sister. I am the youngest in the family,<br>
my sister is the oldest out of my two siblings and she lives in Moline.<br>
My brother recently moved down to Nasheville with his fiancé, so that <br>
leaves me alone with my parent in Plainfield, Illinois. At home, I also<br>
have two cats, a rabbit, and a turtle.</p> <br>


<h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hope to relearn some programming skills i have lost since high school</li>
    <li>Find enjoyment and have fun with programming</li>
    <li>Learn better problem-solving skills</li>
    <li>Learn time management</li>
    <li>Learn to create and design websites</li>
</ul> <br>


<h2>My Favorite Activity</h2>
<p>My favorite hobby/activity is easily running. Its been a large part of my life the last 6 years.<br>
I started running in 5th grade, but I didn’t take it seriously as a sport until high school.<br>
I am now apart of the Lewis Cross Country and Track team. In track, I am a steeplechaser<br>
which is a fun/challenging event that they do not have at the Highschool level. Running<br>
has really shaped my lifestyle and has led me to find some of my best friends and<br>
people I look up to in my life.</P>
<br>


<h2>Fun Fact</h2>
<p>I met Shaq at a McDonald’s in the mountains of Tennessee while driving home from Florida.</p>
